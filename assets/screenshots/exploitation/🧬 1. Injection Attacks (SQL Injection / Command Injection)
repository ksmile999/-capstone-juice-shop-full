## 🧾 Injection Attacks — Detailed Section (New)

This section lists the **types of injection attacks** encountered or relevant to the assessment, with short technical descriptions and the practical impact observed in the lab.

### SQL Injection (SQLi)
**What it is:** Insertion of malicious SQL statements into an application's input fields that are then executed by the database.  
**Observed in this project:** Authentication bypass (login as admin/bender/jim), schema extraction from `sqlite_master`, data exfiltration using `UNION SELECT`.  
**Impact:** Account takeover, data disclosure, data manipulation, potential full system compromise.  
**Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries/prepared statements, input validation, least-privilege DB accounts.

### Command Injection (OS Command Injection)
**What it is:** Execution of arbitrary system commands on the host by injecting shell metacharacters into inputs that are passed to system shells.  
**Observed / risk:** Not directly exploited in the lab, but backups & exposed configs increase the risk if server-side scripts execute unsafe inputs.  
**Impact:** Remote code execution, server takeover.  
**Mitigation:** Avoid shelling out with user input; validate and sanitize inputs; use safe APIs.

### XML / XPath / XXE Injection
**What it is:** Maliciously crafted XML content or XPath payloads to read unauthorized data, perform SSRF or cause parser-based attacks.  
**Observed / risk:** Uploading `xml.html` to deprecated interfaces demonstrated legacy XML handling; XXE risk exists where XML parsing occurs.  
**Impact:** Data exfiltration, SSRF, server-side file reads.  
**Mitigation:** Disable external entity resolution, use secure XML parsers, validate XML inputs.

### Template Injection
**What it is:** Injecting template language expressions into user input that are rendered server-side (e.g., Jinja, Twig) leading to code execution.  
**Observed / risk:** No direct exploit, but discovered file contents and config could expose template render points.  
**Impact:** Remote code execution in the app context.  
**Mitigation:** Escape template inputs, avoid rendering user-controlled templates, restrict template engine features.

### LDAP / Command-Like Injection
**What it is:** Injection into LDAP queries or other structured query languages leading to unauthorized queries.  
**Observed / risk:** Low in this lab, but any direct string interpolation into LDAP or other protocols is dangerous.  
**Impact:** Unauthorized authentication bypass, data access.  
**Mitigation:** Use parameterized LDAP libraries, validate inputs.

### CRLF / Header Injection
**What it is:** Injecting carriage-return/line-feed characters into inputs that are placed into HTTP headers or logs, leading to header splitting or log injection.  
**Observed / risk:** Possible where user-supplied strings are copied into headers or log lines.  
**Impact:** Cache poisoning, response splitting, log forging.  
**Mitigation:** Sanitize header values, reject control characters, canonicalize inputs.

## 🛡️ Recommendations
- Enforce **server-side input validation** and whitelists.  
- Use **parameterized queries / prepared statements** for all DB operations.  
- Enforce **strong password policies**, rate-limiting and MFA for sensitive accounts.  
- Remove backups and development artifacts from public web roots.  
- Harden file upload controls — validate file signatures (magic bytes), not just extensions.  
- Disable XML external entities and use secure parsers.  
- Implement RBAC and server-side authorization checks on every sensitive endpoint.  
- Maintain dependency hygiene and scan for typosquatting or malicious packages.
