# Information Disclosure and OSINT Exploitation

**Category overview**  
Information Disclosure and OSINT Exploitation cover cases where publicly accessible data, debug artifacts, or inadvertent disclosures reveal sensitive information that aids attackers. This includes secrets in public repositories, comments or metadata exposing endpoints, misconfigured privacy pages, and reliance on knowledge-based secrets discoverable via open sources. Attackers use this information to craft targeted attacks, bypass controls, and accelerate compromise.

## Overview Observed in This Assessment

The assessment identified several information-disclosure issues in a controlled Juice Shop lab:

- **Björn’s Favorite Pet** — a password-reset secret was discoverable through public YouTube content and social OSINT.  
- **Forgotten Developer Backup** — backup filenames and artifacts revealed internal project structure and secrets.  
- **Privacy Policy Inspection** — HTML comments and policy text contained hidden endpoint clues and developer notes.

Each finding below contains concise Steps to Reproduce, Impact, and Mitigations.

### A Björn’s Favorite Pet (OSINT-Based Secret Disclosure)

**What it is**  
Using public-facing content (social posts, videos, documentation) as part of authentication or recovery exposes secrets when those sources are discoverable.

**Observed in lab**  
A security-question answer used for password recovery matched information publicly shared in a YouTube video or channel description, enabling a reset without authorization.

**Steps to Reproduce (concise)**  
1. Search public channels and social media for the target’s name or related topics.  
2. Identify candidate answers (pet names, birthdays, locations) appearing in posts or descriptions.  
3. Use the discovered value in the password-reset flow to complete recovery.

**Impact**  
- Account takeover via easy, low-effort reconnaissance.  
- Amplified risk if the same secret is reused across services.  
- Undermines the confidentiality of account recovery mechanisms.

**Mitigations**  
- Avoid knowledge-based recovery that depends on public facts; use token-based email/SMS resets.  
- Educate users not to publish answers to common security questions.  
- Implement MFA and monitor recovery attempts for anomalous patterns.

### B Forgotten Developer Backup (Artifact-Driven Disclosure)

**What it is**  
Deployment artifacts, backup files, or repository remnants disclose internal filenames, configuration, or credentials when left in public-facing locations.

**Observed in lab**  
A backup filename discovered (via directory listing, predictable path, or embedded references) allowed retrieval of a `.bak` file that revealed package metadata and potentially secrets.

**Steps to Reproduce (concise)**  
1. Enumerate common artifact and backup paths (e.g., `/backup`, `/ftp`, `*.bak`, `*.old`).  
2. Request identified file names or follow links found in site code/comments.  
3. Download and inspect contents for credentials, schema, or endpoints.

**Impact**  
- Rapid reconnaissance and identification of internal structures and secrets.  
- Enables targeted attacks using discovered credentials or topology information.  
- Increases severity of other vulnerabilities by revealing exploitable context.

**Mitigations**  
- Exclude development artifacts and backups from production builds and public repositories.  
- Scan deployments for common backup extensions and remove or restrict them.  
- Encrypt backups and store them behind authenticated admin-only interfaces.

### C Privacy Policy Inspection (Hidden Endpoint Clues in Content)

**What it is**  
Legal pages, README sections, or HTML comments that include developer notes, debug URLs, or hidden endpoints leak attack-relevant intel when left in production content.

**Observed in lab**  
HTML comments and sections of the privacy policy contained internal endpoint paths and developer notes that guided discovery of hidden routes and challenge mechanisms.

**Steps to Reproduce (concise)**  
1. Review site HTML, policy pages, and static assets for comments or developer notes.  
2. Crawl privacy/terms pages and inspect served text for endpoint-like strings.  
3. Probe discovered paths and validate accessible resources.

**Impact**  
- Reduced attacker effort for mapping internal endpoints and uncovering hidden functionality.  
- Facilitates exploitation chains by revealing entry points or feature flags.  
- Weakens security-by-obscurity defenses and aids automated tooling.

**Mitigations**  
- Strip HTML comments and developer notes from production builds.  
- Review and sanitize legal or static content to avoid embedding implementation details.  
- Treat public docs as part of the attack surface during threat modeling and redact sensitive info.

## Detection and Logging Recommendations

- Alert on requests to uncommon or internal-looking paths discovered in static content.  
- Integrate content scanning in CI to detect comments, TODOs, or endpoint-like strings before deployment.  
- Monitor for repeated or automated queries to pages that historically contained hidden content.

---

## Hardening Checklist

- Remove backup files and developer artifacts from public servers; restrict access via authenticated admin channels.  
- Replace knowledge-based recovery with secure token flows and require MFA for recovery actions.  
- Sanitize and minify HTML/content in build pipelines to remove comments and debug strings.  
- Run OSINT assessments as part of threat modeling to identify externally discoverable secrets.  
- Add automated content checks in CI/CD to reject deployments containing known secret patterns or internal endpoints.
