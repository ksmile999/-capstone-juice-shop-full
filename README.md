## 📚 Methodology
The testing process followed the **OWASP Testing Guide** and **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**:

1. **Information Gathering**  
   OSINT, service discovery, and directory enumeration.  
2. **Vulnerability Analysis**  
   Identification of weaknesses via Burp Suite and manual inspection.  
3. **Exploitation**  
   Demonstrating how vulnerabilities can be exploited safely.  
4. **Post-Exploitation & Impact Assessment**  
   Evaluating real risks, privilege escalation, and data exposure.  
5. **Remediation**  
   Providing detailed mitigation recommendations for each issue.
